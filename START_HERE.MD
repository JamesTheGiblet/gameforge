# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to GameForge

This project is an exploration into evolutionary game design. You can create and evolve playable mini-games using genetic algorithms, guiding the process with your own ratings of what's fun.

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Concept

GameForge evolves complete mini-games by treating game mechanics, physics, visuals, and difficulty as genetic traits. Players guide evolution by playing the games and rating their fun factor.
