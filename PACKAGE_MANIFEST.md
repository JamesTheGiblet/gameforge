## 🐛 Known Issues & Workarounds

### **Issue #1: Library doesn't persist**
**Cause:** Private/Incognito mode, or localStorage disabled  
**Workaround:** Use normal browsing mode, export library as JSON backup  
**Status:** By design (browser security)

### **Issue #2: Occasional frame drops**
**Cause:** Too many particles + enemies + platforms  
**Workaround:** Evolve towards simpler games, or close other tabs  
**Status:** Minor, rare occurrence

### **Issue #3: Game "feels" too easy/hard**
**Cause:** Genome fitness not aligned with player preference  
**Workaround:** Use appropriate environment, rate more games  
**Status:** Working as intended (subjective)

### **Issue #4: Export but no import**
**Cause:** Import feature not yet implemented  
**Workaround:** Currently export is for backup only  
**Status:** Planned for v1.1
