# 🚀 Quick Start Guide

Follow these steps to start evolving your own games with GameForge.

## 1. Run the Application

This project is a single, self-contained HTML file.

* Open the `gameforge.html` file in a modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).

That's it! The application will load, and the first game will be ready to play.

## 2. Play the Game

Use your keyboard to control the game:

* **Move:** `Arrow Keys` or `WASD`
* **Jump (Platformer):** `Spacebar`
* **Switch Lanes (Runner):** `Up/Down Arrow Keys` or `W/S`

## 3. Guide Evolution

Your feedback is what drives evolution.

* **Rate Fun:** Click the stars (⭐) to give a game a rating from 1 to 5.
* **Like/Skip:** Use the `👍 Like` (5 stars) and `👎 Skip` (1 star) buttons for quick ratings.
* **Next Game:** Click the `⏭️ Next` button to cycle through the current population of games.
* **Evolve:** Once you've rated a few games, click the `🧬 Evolve` button to create a new generation based on your feedback.

## 4. Explore

* Use the controls on the right-hand panel to change the **Genre**, **Mutation Rate**, and other evolutionary parameters.
* **Save** your favorite games to the library.
